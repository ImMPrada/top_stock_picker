## Stock picker

A challenge on [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker)

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

```
> stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
=> [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```
